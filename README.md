# Healthcare-Website-Automated-With-Cypress
In this Cypress automation project, the website CURA Healthcare Service is automated using Cypress for end-to-end testing. The test inputs are extracted from an Excel file, which is converted into a JSON format to easily manage the data for multiple test cases. A custom method called multiIt is implemented to streamline the process of running multiple test cases in a batch. Unlike the traditional it block, which runs only a single test case, multiIt handles multiple test scenarios efficiently, allowing different data sets to be used in each iteration, improving test coverage and reducing redundancy in the code.
