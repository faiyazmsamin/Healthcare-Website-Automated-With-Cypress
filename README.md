# Healthcare-Website-Automated-With-Cypress
This Cypress automation project is designed to test the CURA Healthcare Service website. The primary goal is to automate repetitive testing tasks, ensuring the website's functionality, consistency, and user experience.

**Key Features:**

**- Data-Driven Testing:** Inputs for test cases are extracted from an Excel file, providing flexibility and reducing manual data entry.

**- Excel to JSON Conversion:** Cypress converts the Excel data into a JSON format, making it suitable for consumption within the automation scripts.

**- Custom multiIt Method:** This custom method enhances test case execution by allowing multiple test cases to be run in a batch within a single it block. This improves efficiency and organization of the test suite.
